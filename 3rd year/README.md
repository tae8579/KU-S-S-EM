# KU-S&S-EM
Improved Network Protocol Reverse Engineering (3rd Year)

In this project, we propose a new approach to protocol inference through the improved KU-S-S-EM project.

## Introduction
Network Protocol Inference of aSTEAM Project (Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT). 
This software uses biometric sequencing algorithms to extract characteristics of data for traffic data that is unknown or encrypted and uses characteristic information that is defined and extracted statistically to perform traffic service classification through a fuzzy inference system.

## Requirements and Dependencies
* OS : `Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS`
* Language : `Python 3.5`, `Python 3.6`
* Library : `PIL`, `Pydot`

## Instructions
* Instructions for Use of `KU-S-S-EM`
  1. Open a terminal
  2. Excute `EDA.py`

```shell script
$ python EDA.py
```

`AVG_IVL`: Average interval of packet

`AVG_SKN`: Static keyword number average

`AVG_SKL`: Static keyword length average

`AVG_FSA`: Field size average

`AVG_PAY`: Average size of payload

`AVG_CNT`: Average count of packet

`PCL`: Protocol Number
